## Whatâ€™s `SLbooster`?

The package includes both modified learning and screening algorithms from the R-package SuperLearner and
other algorithms as well. The provided wrappers are meant to be stable even when confronted with complex/unusual data structures and 
provide additional output, such as the time used by the respective algorithms, or variables screened by learners.
